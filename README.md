### Technical Details
Text Processing Pipeline

Raw File ‚Üí Text Extraction ‚Üí OCR (if needed) ‚Üí Cleaning ‚Üí Chunking ‚Üí TTS ‚Üí MP3

### Key Components
* extractors.py: Multi-library PDF extraction with quality scoring
* cleaners.py: Comprehensive text cleaning and normalization
* chunking.py: Smart sentence-aware text segmentation
* processor.py: Orchestrates the entire text processing pipeline

### PDF Processing Strategy
1. Attempts extraction with multiple libraries (pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, pypdf)
2. Scores text quality using metrics like word length and spacing
3. Applies OCR when native extraction quality is poor
4. Compares OCR vs native results and chooses the best

### Text Cleaning Features
* Fixes hyphenated line breaks
* Removes running headers and page numbers
* Strips footnote markers and references
* Normalizes quotes and special characters
* Corrects punctuation spacing
* Handles "jammed" text (missing spaces)

### Configuration Options
Voice Settings
* Voice: Choose from 20+ English neural voices
* Rate: Adjust speaking speed (-50% to +50%)
* Pitch: Modify voice pitch (-300Hz to +300Hz)

Text Cleaning
* Remove Headers: Strip running headers and page numbers
* Remove Footnotes: Clean footnote markers and references

### File Support
Supported Formats
* PDF: Any PDF with text or images (OCR applied automatically)
* TXT: Plain text files in UTF-8 or Latin-1 encoding

File Size Limits
* Designed for documents up to ~500 pages
* Automatic chunking prevents memory issues
* Processing time scales with document length

### Known Limitations
* OCR Complexity: Image-based PDFs may have text recognition errors
* Language Support: Optimized for English text only
* Complex Layouts: Tables and multi-column layouts may not convert perfectly
* Special Characters: Some Unicode characters may be simplified

### Common Issues
"ERROR: Not a valid PDF file"
* Ensure your file is a proper PDF (not a renamed image)
* Try re-saving the PDF from your PDF viewer

Poor audio quality
* Check the source text quality
* Try adjusting voice settings
* Consider manual text cleanup for complex documents

OCR taking too long
* Large image-based PDFs can take several minutes
* Check your ocrmypdf installation
* Consider processing smaller sections

Missing audio for some text
* Check for special characters that might break TTS
* Review the cleaned text output for issues

### Acknowledgments
* Built with Streamlit for the web interface
* Uses Edge TTS for speech synthesis
* PDF processing powered by pdfplumber, PyMuPDF, and pypdf
* OCR capabilities via ocrmypdf
